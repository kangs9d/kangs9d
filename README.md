# Park, Jun Ha
backend developer with experience in various kinds of fields, and I'm also working on a devOps role. Currently **not looking** for a job.

# Skills
- Rust! Making rust-based full stack web framework these days (with Axum)
- Golang, thinking of it as a good alternative for Rust, when it comes to enterprise section.
- TypeScript (Have spent most of my career in this language)
- TerraForm

# Social Status
- SNU student, still not graduated (3rd grade)
- It's my 3rd full-time job, but if I have to count my own (failed) startups, then it goes up to 6.
- Working as a senior software engineer
- Married, and also have 1 dog and 2 parrots
- Living in Seoul

# What I like
- My lovely wife
- Cars! specially Tesla (Not stocks, just car itself)
- Making something, such as novels, musics or drawing. Also like to read/enjoy something that others created. I really liked '3 bodies', and 'All Tomorrows'.
- Music -> Recently I really like to hear Chudahye Chagis's music, and Jambinai. I also like any kinds of musical, and band music
- I really like to talk with something historical, or scientific topics. Such as
  - If Ancient Rome and Ancient China had an all-out war around 30CE, who would win?
  - Are paper straws scientifically better for the environment than plastic straws?
- League Of Legends! I recently reached Emerald 4
- Anyone who has a true, unvarnished, and consistent attitude toward life
- Anyone from whom I can learn something
- Animals! I really like animals (especially dogs and parrots)

# What I don't like
- Hate Speech for anything
- Harmful technologies, something pollutes nature
- Any idea of equating the collective with the individual, no matter what.

# Life goals
I just want pleasant, cozy, safe life for all, But at the same time, I really want to be a big person who has achieved something big that barely no one has ever reached. I can say that I really like fortune, but it's not a matter of physical thing.
